This is the view that players will play cards.
First we will need to check the session of any browser joining
and if they arent logged in, redirect them to a login page (just give your user id)
That way they can be connected to their hand. They can also opt to create a player
for this game.

<% player_name = @player_id["name"].to_s %>
<%= "You are: " + player_name %>
<% @players.each do |player| %>
  <div class="player-box">

        <%# Card.create!(:room_id => @room_id, :value => val, :suit =>  suit, :owned_by => player_name) %>
        <% cards = Card.where(owned_by: player[:name], room_id: @room_id) %>
