This is the view that players will play cards.
First we will need to check the session of any browser joining
and if they arent logged in, redirect them to a login page (just give your user id)
That way they can be connected to their hand. They can also opt to create a player
for this game.

<% [{:name => 'Player 1'}, {:name => 'Player 2'}].each do |player| %>
  <div class="player">
    <%= player[:name] %>
    <div class="hand">
<!--      <%# player.cards.each do |card| %> This probably won't work, needs to select from PlayerCard where PlayerID = Player.ID (maybe this is done in the controller?) -->
      <% [{:suit => "Heart", :value => "Ace"}, {:suit => "Club", :value => "Six"}].each do |card| %>
        <div class="card"> <!-- Or use an asset here instead -->
          <div>
            <%= card[:value] %>
          </div>
          <div>
            <%= card[:suit] %>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
